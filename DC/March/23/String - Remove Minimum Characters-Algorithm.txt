STEP 1: Store input in a string

STEP 2: Find its length

STEP 3: Initiate a while loop (ie. while(ture))

STEP 4: If overlaping found get that index and delete that element and decrement length increment count

STEP 5: If if no overlaping found but lenght is odd delete delete the last element , decrement lenght and increment count

STEP 6: If no overlapping found and lenght is even break the while loop and print count
